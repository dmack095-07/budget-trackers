  ## Description:
  I created this project for offline functionality. A user can input their expenses without an internet connection. Once connected back online, the expenses will automatically populate from offline.

  For this application you need to 'npm install', then 'npm install express', 'npm install mongoose', and 'npm install compression'. Once all the packages are installed you can then run the application by inputting 'npm start'.

  ## Usage:
  This application can be used to bring offline expenses online.
